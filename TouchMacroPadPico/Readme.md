The [**Pico 1 RP2040**](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) and the [**Pico 2 RP2350**](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico-2/), are used as a **Touch LCD MacroPad** with direct access to six file-types: (a) file-path-pointers (similar to symbolic links - note 3), (b) macros (note 4), (c) textstrings (note 5), (d) linkfiles (note 2), (e) \*codes (note 6), and (f) key-label-definitions (note 8). From Layout 2 (Configuration), 92,628 files or "nKeys", grouped as 36 sets of type (a) (aA01-xX996 and 0001-9996), and 14,940 files of types (b) to (e), are directly available from the right-side touch Pad [n] - with the Pad character showing the current selected nKeys character set (note 7).<br> 

From Layouts 1, 3, and 4 (Macro Sets M, S and T), nine sets of 24 keys of types (b), (c), (d), and (e), (mM01-mM24, sS01-sS24, tT02-T24), where each keyset M, S, T can have descriptive and easily changeable, 5-character-maximum-length, labels, as well as another six sets of 99 files (aA01-aA99 and kK01-kK99), are available (note 1). Each of the Macro and text keys and files, can be further linked through a plaintext list of 3-letter filenames with additional processing such as delay and repeat, storage switching, and chaining  or further linking. There are also another 456 (19 sets of 24 files), text files which can be accessed from the SDCard using the same macro-keys. Processing of very large text files, tested up to 67kB (manual.h), but probably only limited by SDFS or LittleFS or FAT32 filesystem size constraints, are available through the nKeys sets.<br> 

<img src="images/pad04.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> There are more than 60 different pages (excluding the 8,964 nKeys pages), and layouts for actions such as Media-keys (Volume Mute Play-Stop Next-Previous Bass-Treble), inserting up 1,080 special characters such as the Greek alphabet, and various mathematical and scientific symbols, a Restart-Shutdown Timer and Time(Clock) Configuration, Timer-and-Time-executed repeat-and-oneshot macros, a Macro Composition, Manipulation, File, and Linking editor, a Mouse-button, Scroll-wheel and cursor movement Keypad, an enhanced 8 page Numberpad, and easy access for the display of PC sensor data (via HWInfo), Music Player information (via Foobar2000), PC Time or Date values, and many other manipulated data sources from a PC running GNU/Linux, and/or Windows.<br> 

**Note 1:** Macro definitions (A1-A99, K1-K99, S1-S24, T1-T24, M1-M24), and the 36 x 996 nKeys set, can be stored on the flash file-system as lowercase filenames (such as s1-s24 etc), or uppercase filenames (S1-S24), or on the SDCard as case-insensitive but case-preserving files (s=S1-s=S24 etc.), using Layouts 1,3, and 4 - and many times more are available from Layout 2.<br> 

**Note 2:** Linklist files can be chained to load another linklist file, through LxyXnn where Xnn is the name of the next XnnLink file to be loaded and executed according to its content, and Lxy indicates various SDCard/Flash options for where the next linklist is stored, and how any switch between Flash memory and SDCard storage, should be handled. A repeat = 20 rnn and Rnn with r = repeat 1-99 and R - repeat 100 to 9900, and three delays = 0.5 and 3 seconds, with dnn, ddn, Dnn, DDn with d 0.1-0.9, and 1-99 seconds, D 1-99 minutes, and DDn 1-9 hours, was used in the macrolink string *a50a51dd5a53d03r20a52d03U02* for the macro animation as shown in the right-hand picture above. Refer to the [**manual**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/TouchMacroPadPico/Pico1/manual.md) and the Extras - DuckyPad section, for more details.<br>

<img src="images/nkeys3.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> **Note 3:** The 100k+ nKeys files are neither macros, textstrings, \*codes, key-label-lists, nor linkfiles. For each alphanumeric first character (aA-xX and 0-9), there are a maximum of 83 pages, each with 12 keys per page. They only point to another file through a a pathname - i.e. folder and file name, of any length less than 200 characters, on the same storage (Flash or SDCard) as the current set, to be executed as either a macro, textfile, linkfile, or \*code. There are (at least), 36 x 996 x 3 = 107,568 of these nKeys available for use from Pad [n] in Layout 2. *Redirection* means that for example, if file n01 contains the text /passwords/BoA.txt then pressing nKey n01 will send the text from the file BoA.txt in folder /passwords to the current focus(s)ed PC application such as a browser or text editor. To change the nKeys first character n use a *code \*0n\*char - for example \*0n\*p will change the nKey set, and filenames used to p01 - p996. Use \*Code \*0s\*list-of-10-char to change a quick-access list. Press [Cfg][Opt] and Pad[o] to select the nKeys set or first character, from a list of 10 - the default is n o p q r s t m a k. Note that when the nKey first character is m,s,t,a,k then the nKeys list will interpret these as macros, textstrings, linkfiles or \*codes, and not as a filepath or filename.  From Layouts 1 ,2, and 3 there are 24 M, S, T keys, but 996 in Layout 2. As expected, if the contents of for example, nKey n01 is the text "s11Link", it will attempt the execute the link list contained in the file named "s11Link". Code \*0x\* toggles the naming of the first 99 nKeys between n01-n99 to n001-n099. Use \*0p\*nn to change the number of nKey pages from 83 to a more manageable size - the default is 20 and the minimum is 1 - note that 83 x 12 = 996. Use code \*0d\*/Directory - 20 char max folder name to be used for saving and reading all nKeys files aA-XXnn,0000-9999. Default is "/" - use \*0d\*/ or just \*0d\* to reset to the default i.e. no folder in front of the filename. Use the special entry \*0d\*// where the nKeys char is used as a folder name such as file n03 key [n03], saved/read from folder /n/, or file q112 read/saved in folder /q/.<br> 

The versatility of these *indirected* set of files lies with the *ease in which a large number of actions can be controlled through a single folder rename*. For example: If there are three folders named AppA, AppB, and AppC, and each folder has 96 specialized macros or strings for the three different applications A, B, and C, then changing the folder name AppA, B, C to that contained in a nKey set such as CurrentApp, will redirect the nKey set of for example 96 keys (if nKeys pages=8), to execute the specialized actions for each of the selected Apps A, B, or C. In addition, as the label names for keys other than the nKeys i.e. the keys in Layouts 1,3, and 4 (M,S,T), are also indirected and customizable, these keys can have aplication-specific names after the folder rename (note 8).<br>

**Note 4:** *Macros* are considered here to be that sub-group of HID touch-keys, touch-buttons, and touch-scrollers, that when touch-pressed send and receive, simultaneous or sequential, in (almost) any combination and length, and with variable speed, HID data and control characters via a PC USB interface.<br> 

**Note 5:** *Large text file processing:* The nKeys set can handle very large text strings - preferably stored on the SDCard - using nKeys such as those starting with the letters n,o,p,q,r - each with 996 keys over 83 pages. Keys M,S,T 1-24 are best used for textfiles with less than 200 characters, and M,S,T 25-996 for larger textfiles, or use any of the nKeys such as the N,O,P,Q,R 1-996 quick-access sets, for large text files. Example: Copy two large (>20kB) files named L1 and S12 on the SDCard using a PC. Then program nKey n01 with the content L1 - Use the KeyBrd Editor - press Pad [k] and set n01 as the Source - in brown not white - and then do L[Add]1[Add][Sav]. Test by pressing the nKey [n01]. Change the nKey letter-set to S with [Cfg][Opt]PadKey[o] and then press the nKey [S12] - this was tested for both keys with an opened notepad.<br>

Eight keys - normally the [Cut][Copy]Paste[Delete][Return][cX][cC][cV] keys - can be assigned from 54 functions in Layouts 1, 3 and 4 - the functions are: 1 Delete 2 Backspace 3 Tab  4 AltTab 5 Insert 6 Esc 7 PScr 8 AltPScr 9 Return 10 Snipping 11 OnScrKeyBrd 12 UnDo 13 ReDo 14 CtrAltDel 15 Cut 16 Copy 17 Paste 18 TaskMan 19 Run 20 GuiX 21 Copilot 22-27 Tskbar1-6 28-51 K1-K24 NumLock 52 CapsLock 53 ScrollLock 54. The 24 K keys use the plaintext linking method as explained above - refer to the Extras - DuckyPad section, or the manual, for examples.<br> 

**Note 6:** Controlling both SDCard and Flash file system operations such as folder or file copy, rename, or delete, and user interface appearance and functions, are executed using an extensive set of starcodes which can be run from files stored on Flash or the SDCard, or entered on the TouchLCD's macroeditor, or sent via a PC serial port, or sent from a Powershell command to the MacroTouchpad. For example sending <\*x9\*0102030405060719> will set all 8 special keys - normally the Cut-Copy-Paste-Delete-Return keys, to new actions and labels - the 8 keys will then be Del Bks Tab aTb Ins Esc and [Del] = PrS and [Ret] = Run. Using a Powershell get-process, one can then set these keys according to which PC application is open. These \* commands can also be part of the list of instructions in a macrolink file.<br>

This means it is possible with a single macropad keypress to open for example photoshop on a PC, and at the same time re-configure the macropad keys for photoshop-specific functions. See Note 8 in the [**manual**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/blob/main/TouchMacroPadPico/Pico1/manual.md) for more detail.<br>

<img src="images/1million-macros.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> <img src="images/nKeys106.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> **Note 7:** The number of available macros are easily expanded to 1 million or even 10 million. Refer to [**Src-1M-macros**](https://github.com/TobiasVanDyk/Pico-MCU-from-Raspberry-Pi/tree/main/TouchMacroPadPico/Pico1/Src-1M-macros)). This has 1,079,568 possible nKeys, or 833 pages of 12 keys for each of the 36 first characters over the three different sets of files. All 9,996 nKeys per character are easily accessed via the Pad+ and Pad- PageUp and PageDown Pads.

<img src="images/labels2b.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> <img src="images/labels2a.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> **Note 8:** Keys M, S, T 1-24 in Layouts 1, 3, and 4, can have descriptive and easily changeable, 5-character-maximum-length labels. All custom label definition files are saved on the SDCard and/or Flash memory, and accessed indirectly through the content of three files of type (a), LabelM, LabelS, and LabelT, which contain the path i.e. /folder/filename of the file that has the custom key labels. By default these files are named label1, label2, and label3, and are of type (f). This makes it easy to switch between label-sets for different applications as each label-definition-set file is only 144 bytes in size (24 x 6). It is also a short coding, but followed by a lengthy implementation, exercise to enhance the 100k+ nKeys with customized labels, using the same mechanism employed here. Refer to the manual, section (K) for more details on how to use and change, the M, S and T keys labels, through changing the content of files LabelM, LabelS LableT, and changing the content and names of the label-definition files (initially named label1. label2, label3).

<img src="images/FlashFS1.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> <img src="images/FlashFS2.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> When the TouchLCD is programmed at first, the Flash FS will contain only three files *Config1 80, TimersData 36, and TouchCalData 10*. (The numbers after the filename is the size in bytes) By pressing [Cfg][Sav] with a serial monitor attached a list of all the files on the Flash FS and SDCard FS will be shown, as well as other configuration data. It is possible to choose the SDCard as the FS for all the macro definition files, which reads and writes much faster and reduces Flash wear.<br>

For the Pico 2 the [**Waveshare IPS ILI9488 Pico Touch Display 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm) and the [**Waveshare ST7789 2.8 inch 320x240 LCD**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-2.8.htm), were tested.

For the Pico 1 six different LCD displays were tested:
1. [**Waveshare IPS ST7789  LCD Pico Board 320x240 2.8 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-2.8.htm)
2. [**Waveshare TFT ILI9486 Raspberry Pi Type C 125MHz LCD 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-c.htm)
3. [**Waveshare IPS ILI9486 Raspberry Pi Type B LCD 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/product/3.5inch-RPi-LCD-B.htm)
4. [**Waveshare IPS ILI9488 Pico Evaluation Board Touch LCD 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-eval-board.htm)
5. [**Waveshare TFT ILI9486 Arduino LCD Shield 480x320 4 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/4inch-tft-touch-shield.htm)
6. [**Waveshare IPS ILI9488 Pico Touch Display 480x320 3.5 inch**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm)

LCDs 1, 4, 5, and 6 have built-in SDCard holders, and SDCard modules were added for LCDs 2 and 3.

<img src="images/pico35inside1.jpg" width="40" height="30"/> The [**Waveshare 3.5inch Touch Display**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm) for the Pico 1 is available [**here**](https://www.robotics.org.za/W19907). It and the other Waveshare Pico modules with a USB connection pointing up, can be modified by connecting a cable to the USB D+ and D- Pico bottom TP3 and TP2 pads, and then taking the USB cable out through the side of the enclosure, or adding a USB Type C breakout board such as [**this one**](https://www.pololu.com/product/2585).

<img src="images/SDIO-SD.png" width="30" height="30"/> The [**Pico Evaluation Board**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-eval-board.htm) was modified by adding 3 connecting wires to convert the SDCard SDIO interface to a standard 1-bit SD interface. Remove pins GP5 GP18 GP19 from the Pico MCU male header. Then use the female Pico SMD header connections on the display board to connect the three wires as indicated below - note that the Pico 1 and 2 SDIO interface is now (2025), supported by the filesystem used here:  
```
D3 CS GP22 stay as is
CLK GP5 disconnect from Pico and connect to GP10 SPI-1 CLK
CMD GP18 disconnect from Pico and connect to GP11 SPI-1 MOSI
D0 GP19 disconnect from Pico and connect to GP12 SPI-1 MISO
```

Of the 6 different LCD displays used here, the fast [**Waveshare 3.5 inch Type C 125MHz LCD display**](https://www.waveshare.com/3.5inch-rpi-lcd-c.htm) and the [**Waveshare 3.5inch Touch Display**](https://www.waveshare.com/pico-restouch-lcd-3.5.htm), are the preferred choices when using a Pico 1, and the latter when using a Pico 2. The Type-C LCD is available [**here**](https://www.robotics.org.za/W15811). The difference in angle clarity between the TFT LCDs (the Arduino-type 4" and the 3.5" Type C LCDs), and the other four IPS type LCDs (three 3.5" and one 2.8"), are noticable, and therefore the last four LCDs may be preferred. The slower Waveshare 3.5" IPS Type B LCD was/is available [**here**](https://www.diyelectronics.co.za/store/displays/1632-5-inch-rpi-ips-lcd-320480.html). All the displays have their touch surface protected by a suitably-sized transparent laser-print-film. 

Not all SDCard brands work equally well - Sandisk, Toshiba, and Samsung SDCards have been used without any problems - if after a cold start the Touchpad does not respond, and only works after the HW reset button had been pressed, then replace the SDCard with another brand. As an alternative, enable the on-start-reset with \*r1\* - but doing this will prevent the Touchpad from being used during the Boot/BIOS phase.

Usability guidelines for touch macro pads are difficult to find, but these [**Material Design Layout Guidelines**](https://m2.material.io/design/layout/understanding-layout.html#layout-anatomy) are in part, applicable. Note that the older versions of these guidelines were much better suited for using as a usability design tool. 

<img src="images/handposition.png" width="40" height="30"/> The Touch LCD is used more conveniently when placed upright rather than lying flat, and then using your thumb-tip to press the 5 option pads, and the larger key pads. The single-touch characteristic of resistive touch overlays is in this case advantageous. Place one or two fingers on top or behind, the LCD to stabilise it when using your thumb to press the keys. This orientation is then similar to the current use of both thumbs to manipulate smartphones touch screens from the side, as opposed to using other fingers pushing on the touchscreen front.
